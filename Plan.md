USER: 
```
I want to create an app to brainstorm and structure ideas/thoughts (for projects, games, plans etc)

The workflow is the user types something could be 1 word, could be a sentence when he press enter a node is added

These nodes are automatically connected, positionned automatically in an infinite graph in an intelligent way (no user action required the system does it automatically)

Nodes can have many connections 

The graph can be extracted to markdown or json (for llm consumption)

there can be hundreds of nodes

It is possible to edit and delete nodes

The ui is really snappy

The ui is gorgeous and delightful to use

Very fast intuitive and slick

Can be operated with keyboard only (command palette actions)

Can be llm powered for node suggestions (nice to have)

Zoom/pan etc

Node search

Graph must be really well organized and formatted

There is a clear identifier to represent the "topic" of the node


here is a mermaid diagram that represents a brainstorm session (dont overfit to this example in particular it is just there to give you a taste)
